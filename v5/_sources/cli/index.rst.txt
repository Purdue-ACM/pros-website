CLI

During the PROS 3 beta phase, the CLI is available by running the command `prosv5`. Once we fully release
PROS CLI 3, we will rename it to the traditional `pros` command. We've done this so that you can continue
to use the PROS 2 with the Cortex while we backport the VEX Cortex functionality.

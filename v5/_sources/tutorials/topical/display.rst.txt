V5 Brain Display (LVGL)
=======================

Interacting with the touchscreen on the V5 Brain is made possible through `LVGL <https://littlevgl.com>`_.
LVGL is a full-featured C graphics library (it's accessible in C++ projects too under the same API).

The first step to getting started with LVGL is to include ``apix.h`` in your ``main.h`` file or other header files.
This includes the full LVGL feature set as described in their documentation: https://littlevgl.com/basics

You can follow along with any of the LVGL `tutorials <https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_examples/tree/master/lv_tutorial>`_
or `wiki <https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl/wiki/Objects>`_. There is no need to port or initialize LVGL, you can simply
start creating objects.

.. note:: Custom LVGL code cannot be displayed at the same time as the `LLEMU <./llemu.html>`_.
          As a result, you must remove the LLEMU code (``pros::lcd``) that is present in ``initialize.cpp`` by default in a
          new project.

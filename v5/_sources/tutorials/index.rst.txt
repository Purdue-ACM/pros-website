Tutorials
=========

Learning a new coding platform is often a rather daunting task. For this
reason we prepared some small tutorials with examples on how to interact
with core components of PROS on your VEX V5 system.

The PROS tutorials are split into three sections:

General Tutorials
=================

If you're still new to writing software or PROS, and looking for additional information
beyond our `Getting Started <../getting-started/index.html>`_ guides, the **General
Tutorials** are a great resource for topics like debugging and the PROS project
structure.

Walkthrough Tutorials
=====================

If you want to write full sample programs to learn to use PROS through practical
applications, or teach students to use PROS in a classroom environment, the
**Walkthrough Tutorials** are a great resource to go step by step through the
process of writing a PROS program.

Topical Tutorials
=================

If you want more information about using a particular part of the PROS API after
reading through the `API reference <../api/index.html>`_ , the **Topical Tutorials**
offer longer examples and more detail about using the PROS API.

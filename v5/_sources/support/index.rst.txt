Support
=======

There are many ways to get support for PROS:

- Open an issue on GitHub for bugs in any PROS software. We generally don't
  consider issues which do not contain steps for reproducing the bug. Look if
	there's already an issue created with your problem. You can open an issue
	against the PROS `kernel <https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros/issues/new>`_,
	`CLI <https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-cli/issues/new>`_,
	`Editor <https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-atom/issues/new`_, or
	`installers <https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-instalers/issues/new`_.
- Join us on `Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/pros-development/shared_invite/enQtMzIyNzA2MTU2MDgwLWNlNTk3ZjA3ZWZmM2Q0YzI3NDZkZWE0MzU4ODdkM2U5MzhjZDY4M2RjNzBiZWYzODk0MTdkYzBiMzJjMWUyYmI>`_
  or `Discord <https://discord.gg/wDpm4qG>`_  for general PROS usage questions.
	If you're having a problem but not sure why, we encourage you to ask on one of
	these	channels.
- Email pros_development (at) cs dot purdue dot edu for other questions. This
  method sometimes has the worst response rate, depending on how busy the
	development team is.
